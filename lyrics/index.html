	<p>
		Everybody loves the things you do <br> 
		From the way you talk to the way you move <br> 
		Everybody here is watching you <br> 
		'Cause you feel like home <br> 
		You're like a dream come true <br> 
		<br> 
		But if by chance you're here alone <br> 
		Can I have a moment before I go? <br> 
		'Cause I've been by myself all night long <br> 
		Hoping you're someone I used to know <br> 
		<br> 
		You look like a movie <br> 
		You sound like a song <br> 
		My God, this reminds me <br> 
		Of when we were young <br> 
		<br> 
		Let me photograph you in this light <br> 
		In case it is the last time <br> 
		That we might be exactly like we were <br> 
		Before we realized <br> 
		We were sad of getting old<br> 
		It made us restless<br> 
		It was just like a movie<br> 
		It was just like a song<br> 
		<br> 
		I was so scared to face my fears<br> 
		Nobody told me that you'd be here<br> 
		And I swear you moved overseas<br> 
		That's what you said, when you left me<br> 
		<br> 
		You still look like a movie<br> 
		You still sound like a song<br> 
		My God, this reminds me<br> 
		Of when we were young<br> 
		<br> 
		Let me photograph you in this light<br> 
		In case it is the last time<br> 
		That we might be exactly like we were<br> 
		Before we realized<br> 
		We were sad of getting old<br> 
		It made us restless<br> 
		It was just like a movie<br> 
		It was just like a song<br> 
		<br> 
	</p>

	<p class = "chorus">
		When we were young [4x]<br> 
		<br> 
	</p>

	<p>
		It's hard to admit that<br> 
		Everything just takes me back<br> 
		To when you were there<br> 
		To when you were there<br> 
		And a part of me keeps holding on<br> 
		Just in case it hasn't gone<br> 
		I guess I still care<br> 
		Do you still care?<br> 
		<br> 
		It was just like a movie<br> 
		It was just like a song<br> 
		My God, this reminds me<br> 
		Of when we were young<br> 
		<br> 

		<p class="chorus">
			When we were young [4x]<br> 
			<br> 
		</p>

		<p>
			Let me photograph you in this light<br> 
			In case it is the last time<br> 
			That we might be exactly like we were<br> 
			Before we realized<br> 
			We were sad of getting old<br> 
			It made us restless<br> 
			Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old<br> 
			It makes me reckless<br> 
			It was just like a movie<br> 
			It was just like a song<br> 
			When we were young<br> 
			<br>
