		<h3>Aesthetic</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Is the design beautiful/striking/remarkable?</li>
			<p> The designs are very crisp, the resolution and the placement is nice. The imagery also complements the typeface choice well.
			</p>
			<li>Does the design aesthetic relate to the concept? </li>
			<p> yes ! very well unified 
			</p> 
			<li>Do the imagery and design choices support the text?</li>
			<p> yes </p>
			<li>Is the aesthetic consistent?</li>
			<p> yes </p>
			<li>Is the aesthetic driving the concept, or vice-versa?</li>
			<p> yes </p>
			<li>Is it legible?</li>
			<p> yes </p>
			<li>Are type size/color/face/treatment choices helping or hurting?</li>
			<p> helping </p>
		</ul>
		<h3> Structure </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>What are the designâ€™s visual priorities?</li>
			<li>Are design elements working in contrast, complement, or conflict?</li>
			<li>What elements do you consider foreground? Background?</li>
			<p> the images are nicely fit into the background, and yet they become central in importance over the text because they are so high contrast </p>
			<li>How will the design accommodate variability in browser width?</li>
			<li>Is transparency, if used, used appropriately?</li>
		</ul>

	<h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>What happens at all of the sizes in between the desktop and mobile versions that have been provided? </li>
		<p> the text merges over and scales down, it should be manageable for a solid responsive design </p>
		<li> Will elements such as fonts transfer as intended to the browser environment? </li>
		<p> yes, it is a font that can be accessed via google fonts/typekit </p>
		<li> Can you build it? </li>
		<p> yes </p>
