Everybody loves the things you do <br> 
From the way you talk to the way you move <br> 
Everybody here is watching you <br> 
'Cause you feel like home <br> 
You're like a dream come true <br> 
<br> 

But if by chance you're here alone <br> 
Can I have a moment before I go? <br> 
'Cause I've been by myself all night long <br> 
Hoping you're someone I used to know <br> 
<br> 

You look like a movie <br> 
You sound like a song <br> 
My God, this reminds me <br> 
Of when we were young <br> 
<br> 

Let me photograph you in this light <br> 
In case it is the last time <br> 
That we might be exactly like we were <br> 
Before we realized <br> 
We were sad of getting old<br> 
It made us restless<br> 
It was just like a movie<br> 
It was just like a song<br> 
<br> 

I was so scared to face my fears<br> 
Nobody told me that you'd be here<br> 
And I swear you moved overseas<br> 
That's what you said, when you left me<br> 
<br> 

You still look like a movie<br> 
You still sound like a song<br> 
My God, this reminds me<br> 
Of when we were young<br> 
<br> 

Let me photograph you in this light<br> 
In case it is the last time<br> 
That we might be exactly like we were<br> 
Before we realized<br> 
We were sad of getting old<br> 
It made us restless<br> 
It was just like a movie<br> 
It was just like a song<br> 
<br> 

When we were young [4x]<br> 
<br> 

It's hard to admit that<br> 
Everything just takes me back<br> 
To when you were there<br> 
To when you were there<br> 
And a part of me keeps holding on<br> 
Just in case it hasn't gone<br> 
I guess I still care<br> 
Do you still care?<br> 
<br> 

It was just like a movie<br> 
It was just like a song<br> 
My God, this reminds me<br> 
Of when we were young<br> 
<br> 

When we were young [4x]<br> 
<br> 

Let me photograph you in this light<br> 
In case it is the last time<br> 
That we might be exactly like we were<br> 
Before we realized<br> 
We were sad of getting old<br> 
It made us restless<br> 
Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old<br> 
It makes me reckless<br> 
It was just like a movie<br> 
It was just like a song<br> 
When we were young<br> 
<br>
