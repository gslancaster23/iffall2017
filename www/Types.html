	Garden gnomes are typically males, often bearded, usually wear red phrygian caps and often have pipes. They are made in various poses and shown pursuing various pastimes, such as fishing or napping.
	<br>
	<br>
	Gnomes have become controversial in serious gardening circles in the UK, and have been banned from the prestigious Chelsea Flower Show, as the organisers claim that they detract from the garden designs. The ban was lifted during 2013 to mark the show's centenary. Gnome enthusiasts have accused the organisers of snobbery as garden gnomes are popular in the gardens of working class and suburban households.

	Gnomes may be made from terracotta clay slip (runny clay) poured into molds. This is allowed to set up and the excess emptied from the centre, leaving a clay shell. The gnome is removed from the mold when firm, allowed to dry and then fired in a kiln until hard. Once cooled, the gnome is painted. More modern gnomes are made from resins and similar materials.
	<br>
	<br>
	Today, many different variations of garden gnomes exist, including humorous ones like a gnome stabbed in the back or one with an executioner's hood.
